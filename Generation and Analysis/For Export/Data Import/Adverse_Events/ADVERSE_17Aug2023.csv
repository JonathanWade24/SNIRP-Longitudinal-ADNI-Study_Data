Nursing home sent patient to emergency room and she was admitted to the hospital on 7 June 2020.  She was initially noted to be hypotensive with blood pressure of 70/37.  Lab work showed multiple derangements including leukocytosis, acute kidney injury, lactate 5.4 mmol/L, and myoglobin > 24,000.  She had non-bloody foul-smelling diarrhea.  She was given IV bolus fluids and had improvement in blood pressure.  Diagnosis was GI bleed due to suspected significant intra-abdominal pathology with main concern for ischemic bowel.  Lengthy discussion was had with patient's son/healthcare proxy who is at the bedside.  Due to patient's and sons wishes, decision was made to forego aggressive workup or management.  She was transitioned to comfort care measures including around the clock and as needed analgesia with Dilaudid, Ativan for restlessness, and Haldol for agitation.  Patient expired at 4:40 on 8 jun 2020.

Pt has some vision complaints in his right eye that started 9/16/22 that he told his neurologist about on 9/30/22. He's also been less energetic since mid-August of 2022, reporting that he is sleeping more. Neurologist ordered an MRI that was scheduled for 11/2/22 without contrast. Patient's wife and SP reported to her PCP that he is having increased difficulty ambulating and weakness. The MRI on 11/2 revealed an occipital mass and he was referred to neurosurgery for an appointment on 11/3/22 to discuss treatment and etiology. Pt had a second MRI with contrast on 11/3/22 that confirmed Prescence of a mass that was 7x5.4.5cm in the Left occipital lobe with extension along the temporal parietal junction. There is mild surrounding edema.  The ependymal surface is involved.  Contrast-enhancement appears to extend into the proximal left splenium of the corpus callosum.  The appearance is much more consistent with high-grade glioma, with metastatic disease and lymphoma being considered much less likely.  The neurosurgeon and his oncologist determined that it would be most reasonable to pursue a symptom management strategy. Pt is clinically declining quickly and is now spending most of his time in bed as well as having significant challenges with proprioception, visuospatial awareness, and bladder control. Patient was started on Dexamethasone to 4 mg PO daily with ongoing use of Pepcid to prevent GERD from steroids that were started on 11/6/22.

placement on mechanical ventilation. They all expressed that patient wishes as well as theirs, would be not to go on the breathing machine, i.e. no intubation or mechanical ventilation however, they would like to continue rest of medical management including antibiotics, and rest of medical management -I explained to them that additional antimicrobial will be a form of empiric therapy as it is difficult to determine exact pathogen to target given the inability to perform bronchoscopy and BAL, they
expressed full understanding to our discussion -Geriatric team as well as palliative care team will continue to follow-up with the patient -We have discussed with infectious disease team to continue current antimicrobial consider adding Bactrim for empiric treatment of PCP, given inability to perform diagnostic bronchoscopy with BAL due to risk of intubation given worsening respiratory status for the patient. -CLL status post chemotherapy
